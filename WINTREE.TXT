                                  WINTREE

      WinTree will produce a scrollable listing of all the windows and
      child windows currently active at the time the program is
      executed.

      I wrote this very "down and dirty" program to help me debug some
      code that was trying to create child windows on another
      application's window.  I needed to see if the children were
      getting created in the right place.  (They weren't and still
      aren't!).

      The most helpful part of this program is the recursive
      subroutine called "TraverseWindows" at the end of the listing.
      This is the code that does the real work.  The rest of it is
      just display services.

      The display part is a rip-off of the SYSVALS program in Charles
      Petzold's book.  The algorithm for traversing the trees is an
      extrapolation of a code segment I saw on IBMLink.

      I'm not interested in any money for this code, as it doesn't
      really do much.  I WOULD be interested in hearing if it helped
      you.  I can be contacted via:

                Prodigy         [VWSD07A]
                CompuServe      [73457,365]

      I'm on Prodigy a lot more than CIS.... connect charges ya know.

      Feel free to distribute or modify the code as you wish.  Enjoy.
