Name: 		WINTREE
Descripcion: 	List Active Windows
Date: 		2022-05-07
Version:	2.01
----------------------------   

DESCRIPTION
-----------
WinTree will produce a scrollable listing of all the windows and child windows currently active at the time the program is executed.

Gary Murphy wrote this very "down and dirty" program to help him debug some code that was trying to create child windows on another application's window.  He needed to see if the children were getting created in the right place.

The most helpful part of this program is the recursive subroutine called "TraverseWindows" at the end of the listing.
This is the code that does the real work.  The rest of it is just display services.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- yum install git gcc make libc-devel binutils watcom-wrc watcom-wlink-hll

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
This version of this sample was modified to compile on ArcaOS with GCC 9 compiler. 

1) Remember to have correct header files your path. For GCC the correct ones are the included on the "libc-devel", not the ones from the OS/2 Toolkit. Check your config.sys for "SET INCLUDE=C:\usr\include"

2) Since I'm using the Watcom Resource Compiler (open source) instead of the classic rc.exe, and the the Watcom Linker, intead of the classic ilink.exe, add to your config.sys...
 SET EMXOMFLD_LINKER=wl.exe
 SET EMXOMFLD_TYPE=WLINK
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC_TYPE=WRC
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC=wrc.exe

3) Run "make" or "make 2>&1 |tee make.out" to get the log file.

TOOLS USED
----------
- ArcaOS	- Verion 5.0.7
- gcc		- gcc (GCC) 9.2.0 20190812 (OS/2 RPM build 9.2.0-5.oc00)
- wl		- Watcom Linker
- wrc		- Watcom Resource Compiler
- make 		- Version 3.81 k2 (2017-11-10)

TROUBLESHOOT
------------
The compile produce will run by just executing "make" on the directory. If you want to save the log file you can run it as "make 2>&1 |tee make.out". The log will be saved into the "make.out" file.
